      <description>Autoconf:  The Autoconf Build for the master branch was failing because of the absence of the rtems_bsdnet.h file and I had to disable networking (&amp;ndash;disable-networking) while building the BSP, after which I was able to build the master Branch BSP successfully.
Well, funny enough, using our temporary patch from my previous post, I was able to get the BSP to boot and bring the console up when built with Autoconf.</description>

      <description>Some context, to the blog post ahead:  It&amp;rsquo;s been a week into the coding period of the GSoC&#39;21 at RTEMS, more than a week since I actually started working, and a few meets and emails have been exchanged with the mentors and the ever-so-helpful RTEMS community.
Initial Hiccups: I started off trying to build the RTEMS 6 (henceforth referred to as Master) Raspberry Pi BSPs. There&amp;rsquo;s two(rather, three) ways to build the BSPs.</description>
