<p>

My research spans VLSI design, computer architecture, circuits and compilers. I am currently advised by Prof. [Tulika Mitra](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tulika/). 

I have been a [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about) Fellow with [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/), I have worked in the Interconnects IP Group at [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) and was advised by Prof. [Abhijit Asati](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/abhijitasati/Profile) during my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) at [BITS Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITS_Pilani).
