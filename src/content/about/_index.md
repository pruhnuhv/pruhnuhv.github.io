<h3> Hey! </h3>
I am pranav, I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, India, currently.
I like tinkering with Hardware, Software and am probably stuck in some abstraction layer between the two right now.

<h3> Interests </h3>
I like Embedded Systems, the Internet of Things(IoT), Reverse Engineering, Digital Design, the Linux Kernel, among a lot of other things. Over time, I am trying to
use and contribute to free and open source hardware/software more & more. I strongly support Internet Freedom, Digital Rights and like reading up about the same.
