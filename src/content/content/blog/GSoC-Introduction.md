<p>The next few posts are a part of a series of posts detailing my work done during GSoC for RTEMS</p>
<h3> GSoC at RTEMS </h3>
<p><strong><strong>Improving The Rapsberry Pi BSP: </strong></strong>
RTEMS Project already supports the Raspberry Pi 1, My project over the summer aims to add support for the Raspberry Pi Zero, Pi Zero W and the Raspberry Pi 3. This would include the basic Board Support Package (BSP), including but not limited to Interrupts, UART, I2C, SPI and Symmetric Multiprocessing.
