I am a student researcher advised by Prof. [Tulika Mitra](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tulika/). 
I like to work on Computer Architecture, VLSI Design, Circuits and Semiconductor Fabrication, Compilers and everything in between.

Previously, I have worked in the Interconnects IP Group at Intel and with Prof. [Abhijit Asati](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/abhijitasati/Profile) at BITS Pilani, India.
