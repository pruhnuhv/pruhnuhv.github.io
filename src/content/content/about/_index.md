My research interests span VLSI design, computer architecture, circuits, compilers and everything in between. I am currently advised by Prof. [Tulika Mitra](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tulika/). 

Previously, I have been a GSoC Fellow with [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/), and I have worked in the Interconnects IP Group at Intel and with Prof. [Abhijit Asati](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/abhijitasati/Profile) at BITS Pilani, India.
