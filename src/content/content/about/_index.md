<h3> Hey! </h3>
I am Pranav (he/him/his), an Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, India, currently.
I like tinkering with Hardware, Software and am probably stuck in some abstraction layer between the two right now.

<h3> Interests </h3>
I like Embedded/Real-Time Systems, the Internet of Things(IoT), Reverse Engineering, FPGAs & Digital Design, among a lot of other things. I believe technology should be free and fair, so I am trying to use as well as contribute towards free and open source hardware/software. I strongly support Internet Freedom, Digital Rights and like reading up about the same. I like listening to Alt rock/Indie/Bollywood lo-fi music. I also watch and play cricket.

* Google Summer Of Code (GSoC'21) at Real Time Executive For Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS)
* Embedded Systems R&D Intern at Nihon Communication Solutions, Bangalore.
